<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Sunny Vinayak — a BCA student from South West Delhi with a deep curiosity for technology and a growing passion
for self-improvement. After a slow academic start, I’ve become laser-focused on building real skills that matter — from
mastering programming languages like Python, C++, and HTML/CSS to understanding the core principles of digital
marketing, project management, and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom, I’m a gym regular and someone who believes discipline outside your work reflects in everything you
do. Whether it’s crafting a clean piece of code or crushing a new PR in the gym, I believe in giving 100% to whatever I
pursue.</p>

<p>I’m currently exploring full-stack development, working on sharpening both front-end and back-end skills, and diving
deeper into real-world tools that power modern tech. I’ve also grown more conscious about health, skincare, and mindful
habits — aiming for long-term personal and professional growth.</p>

<p>When I’m not studying, building, or lifting, I’m usually spending time with my cats (yes, I named one Aluu) or digging
into something new that challenges me to be better. I may not have it all figured out — but I’m on my way, one step at a time.</p>
